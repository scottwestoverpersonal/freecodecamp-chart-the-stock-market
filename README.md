# API Basejump: Chart the Stock Market (Work in progress)

A NodeJS App that allows users to search for stocks and see their recent trend. The app uses web sockets, so you can see other users add stocks in real time. This app uses the Markit On Demand APIs for the stock data.

You can view the live demo here: https://cryptic-temple-88061.herokuapp.com/

### The Web App Does the Following:
* I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.
* I can add new stocks by their symbol name.
* I can remove stocks.
* I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.
